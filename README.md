# Election_Management_System
Developed an Election Management system in Visual C++. It aims to organise and manage elections at all levels within IIT Guwhatai. 
It allows the election organiser to:
- have complete flexibility to choose voters(among hostels,departments and clubs)
- decide nominees for the election
- the date time of the election
- whether to allow voter to apply as nominees or not
- decide the deadline for agenda updates.
- add other organisers for the election

The software maintains complete anonimity of the voter and ensures a secure election. During the time of the voting, it provides a system generated ID and password for the voter which is valid only for 10 minutes. The voter must vote within 10 minutes or else he is not allowed to vote again. 

The admin can
- update students' records
- remove elections for which results have been declared
- approve new elections which are requested on the portal.

Any user can:
- view the elections he is a part of.
- edit the clubs he is a part of
- vote for elections he is a part of.
- if the elections are over, he can view the results of the election. 

The software provides a detailed ananlysis of the the percentage votes for each candidate, the possibility of interviews in case of tie and relection for the particular post in case the NOTA is chosen by 50% of the voters.

To run the software, download and execute the executable available in the repository.
